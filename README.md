# Dolphin_Clock
All you need to download is "Install Dolphin Clock.exe". Feel free to browse the source code.

This software was written by a Dolphin to learn items below and software distribution.
My gratitude extends to SM-AML for providing inspiration for and the source of the dolphin audio.
This software is designed to work on Windows 10, other OS have not been tested (I doubt non-windows OS will work).

Learning path for Dolphin Clock!

Clockv2 - Learning how to add an image into a script and convert to .exe
Clockv3 - Learning how to animate an image
